      <h3>Instructions: </h3>
      <p>
        You are an evil ball. Your goal is to eliminate all of the other balls on the screen.
        This can be achieved by colliding with them. The game ends when there are no more balls left.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can choose to either move your evil ball using the mouse or the keyboard. Using the mouse
        is recommended for an easier experience. Using the keyboard, there are three difficulty levels to
        choose from. When using the keyboard, the evil ball will move in the direction of the WASD keys.
